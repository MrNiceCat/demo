## SenchaDotNet

This sample project demonstrates how SenchaExtJS framework maybe used within Asp.net.  The application is a multi-page sencha app.  Each page within the Sencha context is treated as its own "app" and as such is generated using the sencha generate app command.
The Asp.net View loads the corresponding Sencha app bootstrap file to render the page.
